## Installation:

* Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (to run the Vue development server and to build dist-files).
* Install [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (for hosting of frontend).
  * To publish, you require access to the firebase project.
* Clone the repository into your preferred folder, and `cd` into it. 
* Run `npm run serve` to run a local development server, and you're there!

NOTE: For functionality, the backend must be running as well.
